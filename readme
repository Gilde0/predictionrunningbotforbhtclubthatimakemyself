# Telegram Bot Template

Each user must:
- Use their **own Telegram bot token** from @BotFather  
- Replace all IDs and URLs with their own  
- Never share `.env` publicly  

Example:
```env
BOT_TOKEN=123456:ABCDEF-your-own-bot-token
ADMIN1_ID=987654321
CHANNEL1_ID=-100987654321

### ðŸ”’ Summary
| Whatâ€™s Safe | Whatâ€™s Risky |
|--------------|--------------|
| Giving the **code** | Sharing your **real `.env`** |
| Friends changing their own IDs and tokens | Using your bot token or channel IDs |
| Each person running their own Replit | Sharing one account for multiple bots |
| Using `.env.example` template | Pasting real tokens online (GitHub, chats, etc.) |

---

If youâ€™d like, I can help you:
- Generate a **clean `.env.example` + README.md + LICENSE`** pack ready for upload,  
- Or add support in your code to **auto-detect missing `.env` values** and guide users interactively.  

Would you like me to make that clean starter pack for you?
